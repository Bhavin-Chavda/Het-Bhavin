Resistance training is any exercise that causes the muscles to contract against an external resistance with the expectation of increases in strength, tone, mass, and/or endurance. The external resistance can be dumbbells, rubber exercise tubing, your own body weight, bricks, bottles of water, or any other object that causes the muscles to contract.

    Resistance training works by causing microscopic damage or tears to the muscle cells, which in turn are quickly repaired by the body to help the muscles regenerate and grow stronger. The breakdown of the muscle fiber is called "catabolism," and the repair and re-growth of the muscle tissue is called "anabolism." You're probably familiar with the term anabolic when used with steroids. Anabolic means to grow, and that's exactly what happens after you break down the muscle fibers with resistance exercise. In fact, many biological processes of growth in the body require some breakdown, or catabolism, prior to re-growth. For instance, bones must be broken down first before calcium and other growth factors repair the bone and make it stronger. With muscles, testosterone, insulin-like growth factor, growth hormone, protein, and other nutrients rush to the muscle after a resistance-exercise session to help repair the muscles to make them stronger. Importantly, your muscles heal and grow when you aren't working out, and so that's why it's necessary to leave time between workouts for recovery.

<h2 style="padding:20px; color:rgb(231, 23, 92)">Resistance Exercises</h2>
<hr style="height: 3px; color: rgb(241, 181, 102); margin: 10px;">
<p style="color:rgb(25, 240, 57); padding: 20px;">

    <h4 style="padding:20px; color:rgb(88, 25, 226); display:inline;">Squats</h4>
    <p style="color:rgb(235, 79, 31); padding: 20px;">
        The Squat is quite possibly the ‘Mac-daddy’ (i.e. the best) of all resistance training exercises.  It uses all the major muscles in the lower leg, thighs and hips and when performed correctly uses numerous muscles in the upper body to help protect the spine when load is rested on the upper back and/or shoulders.  As it uses lots of muscle it is great as a calorie burner to help weight loss and toning, and when progressively heavier loads and greater training volumes are used it is possibly the best exercise for building strength and size in the lower body muscles. <br>Squats replicate a primary movement pattern that most people use variations of everyday whether it’s getting in and out of a chair, using the toilet, or picking items off the ground.  There is a version of squats available to suit every client – whether its supported bodyweight squats for the beginner or heavy barbell squats for the more advanced client – the movement is the same, the only variance is the way the movement is loaded and the depth which is safe for each client.
    </p>

    <h4 style="padding:20px; color:rgb(88, 25, 226); display:inline;">Push Ups</h4>
    <p style="color:rgb(235, 79, 31); padding: 20px;">
        The humble old push up is a closed chain exercise that uses all the big pushing muscles of the body – namely the chest, shoulder and triceps.  It also requires core muscles to work to maintain a safe ‘neutral’ spine position throughout the movement, meaning lots of muscle is used during this exercise and because the exercise is closed chain that muscle will work a little harder to try to overcome the immovable barrier being pushed against.So push ups are great exercises for burning calories to achieve muscle firming and toning, weight loss, strengthening and muscle building…all again depending on how the exercise is performed And the push up can be modified to suit any client – full push ups can be performed for the more experienced and able client while push ups can be performed with the knees on the ground or against a bar or a wall the make the exercise easier for beginner clients.
    </p>

    <h4 style="padding:20px; color:rgb(88, 25, 226); display:inline;">Chin Ups / Pull Ups</h4>
    <p style="color:rgb(235, 79, 31); padding: 20px;">
        Using all the big pulling muscles of the body – all the back muscles, the shoulders and the arms, the chin or pull up is a great exercise for firming, toning, building and strengthening all these muscle groups. <br>As chins also use a lot of muscle then they are a great exercise for burning calories and assisting weight loss.  And like the previous exercises the chin or pull up can be modified to suit most clients’ abilities.   Stronger or more experienced clients can perform full chins as shown above and weight can be added to make the exercise even harder.  Less experienced clients can perform pull ups onto a lower bar and shown here, keeping their feet on the ground and thus minimizing the total amount of bodyweight they have pull directly upwards.
    </p>

    <h4 style="padding:20px; color:rgb(88, 25, 226); display:inline;">Lat Pulldown</h4>
    <p style="color:rgb(235, 79, 31); padding: 20px;">
        A great alternative to the chin or pull up is the lateral pulldown which works all the same pulling muscles, and is probably more suited to beginners as the load is easily adjusted. <br>The lat pulldown is known as an ‘open chain’ exercise as opposed to all the previous exercises which are known as ‘closed chain’.  Closed chain exercises are exercises where you push or pull against a fixed or immovable object, whereas open chain exercises are when the resistance that is being pushed or pulled against actually moves.<br>Closed chain exercises have the edge over open chain exercises in terms of effectiveness – as the body cannot overcome the fixed object in closed chain exercises the neuromuscular system actually works a little harder to try to overcome it than it does with open chain exercises, and by working a little harder there is quite simply more benefit. 
    </p>

    <h4 style="padding:20px; color:rgb(88, 25, 226); display:inline;">Bent over Row</h4>
    <p style="color:rgb(235, 79, 31); padding: 20px;">
        Another great pulling exercise is the bent over row which uses all the big pulling muscles as the chins, pull ups and lat pulldown.  As the bar is pulled up to the torso it moves away from the centre of mass of the client, thus pulling the client forward and off-balance.  This places a greater demand on the ‘core’ muscles to stabilise the body during this exercise.<br>And again the more muscle that is used the greater the beneficial effect of the exercise.s
    </p>

    <h4 style="padding:20px; color:rgb(88, 25, 226); display:inline;"> Deadlifts</h4>
    <p style="color:rgb(235, 79, 31); padding: 20px;">
        Along with squats, the deadlift is a serious contender for the ‘Mac-daddy’ of all resistance exercises award.  The deadlift actually combines two primary movement patterns – the squat and the pull, as a weight is pulled into the body, and lowered at the same time as a squat is performed. <br>When appropriately loaded the deadlift uses more muscles than any other resistance exercise – all the lower body muscles, and the majority of the upper body muscles.  As such it is great for burning calories, firming, toning and developing muscles, building strength and size and losing weight – all depending on how it is performed.<br>The deadlift is certainly more complex than the squat and as such may make it unsuitable for beginners, but nevertheless it can be modified to suit different clients – for beginners the bar can be raised off the ground to lessen the depth the client needs to squat down to reach the bar, and for more advanced lifters progressively more load can be added to full range deadlifts.
    </p>

    <h4 style="padding:20px; color:rgb(88, 25, 226); display:inline;">Tricep Pushdown</h4>
    <p style="color:rgb(235, 79, 31); padding: 20px;">
        Well if your definition of functional is truly client centric and linked to the major goals clients have for exercising then this becomes a functional exercise.  One of the areas many female clients want to firm and ‘tone’ is the back of the upper arm.  Now sure, any big pushing exercise like push ups will be more effective for this purpose – it will burn more total calories than the pushdown and stimulate the tricep muscles as well as others. <br>So for pure effectiveness the push up or bench press wins, but throwing a few sets of pushdowns in at the end of a workout (after push ups or bench press) in order to have the client really 'feel' that the areas most important to them are being targeted is very functional, probably more psychologically than physiologically – if it contributes to the client feeling a specific area working and wanting to come back to repeat training sessions then it is a functionally great exercise.
